# MagicTrash this based off of AutoTrash
Automate your trash

### Based off work from

Alexander Pellas, Julian Bertini, Raj Desai, Simon Nim

### Team Members
Haley Fogelson, Jack Simons, Carly Genovere, Bridget Nolan, and Noah Adler


### Project Description

How can we teach the next generation to recycling?
In this project we use the self sorting program from autotrash but instead of a motor we have an LED light strip that Blinks Green for recycling and RED for Trash. The child has to interact with the trash can by pushing a button that puts the item in the right bin. 


### DEMO
